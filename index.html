    The crow wants to silence the people
</p>
<p>
    Do not believe his lies. He builds the world around you, but gives you no agency. The crow flies, yet will you?
    Speak out now my brethren;flee the nest. Will you let the bird indoctrinate you? Where are you potions coming from?
    <p>Give up the beak and let your voice carryupon the wind. If it is good yoiu shall know. if It is wrong then will </p>
    <p>the bird not upon you a silence. </p>
    <p>Out and upon go thine spell.s Fight against the winged ones, they who would oppress. They say they hav a price. Bears paid in man made cooked goods
        but where does the labor happen? </p>
    <p>Cry out against the tyrany. the birds would hav eus upon the ground while they flock in their crimson castles made of our blood and sweat. Rise up</p>
